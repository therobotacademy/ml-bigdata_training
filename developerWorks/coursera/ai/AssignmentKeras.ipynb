    "# Keras exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will be creating a Keras model by loading a data set, preprocessing input data, building a Sequential Keras model and compiling the model with a training configuration. Afterwards, you train your model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set. To finish this exercise, you will then save your model in HDF5 format.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this exercise we will use the Reuters newswire dataset. This dataset consists of 11,228 newswires from the Reuters news agency. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes, just as in the IMDB data we encountered in lecture 5 of this series. Moreover, each wire is categorised into one of 46 topics, which will serve as our label. This dataset is available through the Keras API.\n",

Each of the 1000 vector positions corresponds to one of the words in our newswire corpus. The output of the tokenizer has a 1 at the i-th position of the vector, if the word corresponding to i is in the description of the newswire, and 0 otherwise.
